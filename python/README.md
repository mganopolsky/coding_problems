# Python practice 

# Libraries
Any libraries will need to be added to the `requirements.txt` file, and installed using the command 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

```sh

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

```

# Running the Scripts

Each script will need to be run using the following command: 

```sh
python [python_file.py]
```
