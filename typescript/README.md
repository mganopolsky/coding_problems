# Typescript practice 

# Node.js project initialization:

Initialize a Node.js Project: 

`npm init -y`



# Libraries

Install dependencies using: 
`npm install`

Any libraries will need to be added to the `packages.json` file, and installed using the command 
`npm install [pacakge_name]`


Compile and run typescript code using
```sh
npm start
```

# Running the Scripts

Each script will need to be run using the following command: 

```sh
python [python_file.py]
```
